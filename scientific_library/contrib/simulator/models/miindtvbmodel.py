    MIIND (Multiple Instantiations of Interacting Neural Dynamics) [MDK_2013] is
    a software package which simulates interacting populations of neurons using
    population density techniques [OM_2000]. It has been implemented here to leverage
    the TVB's connectivity and coupling functionality while performing the actual
    region (node) simulation in MIIND.

    **Technical Notes**:

    The Miind class constructor takes a filename which should point to a shared library
    file generated by MIIND which both defines and performs the simulation for each region.
    When using MIIND in TVB, a user can instantiate this Miind class to be used as the model
    in the simulation then "plug and play" different shared library files from MIIND.

    Shared library files can be generated by MIIND to support MPI. While tvb-library
    source files do not require an MPI implementation, the script to run the TVB
    simulation should call MPI_Init to ensure compatability.

    The Miind model class requires that MIIND has been installed on the system.
    Installation instructions are available at
    http://miind.sourceforge.net/
